# Iwocalculator

Angular was chosen as I find its quick to spin up a project bootstrapped with a testing environment. Including the Angular material add on allowed me to build a stylish dynamic table and including bootstrap 4 helped create a crude responsive design.

Given more time I would have improved:
- Responsive design, specifically for mobile window size
- Validate the fields so only integers could be input
- Validate the fields so they could not be empty
- Validate the fields to set min and max values
- Provide user feedback on validation
- Improve lighthouse score to 100 across the board

I would consider rebuilding the app in VueJS as the bundle size would be smaller.

Hosted on Netlify [here](https://sharp-tesla-16e934.netlify.com/).

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 7.2.3.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.

## Running unit tests

Before running tests set the app component property 'unlockTestAnswer' to true :)

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).
